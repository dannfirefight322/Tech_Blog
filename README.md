  # Description
  ### This is an blog that uses express, handlebars, and api routes so a user can log in or create an account. Once a user is logged in they can create a post, edit an existing post, delete a post, or add comments to posts of other users. This app uses a mix of html css and javascript with the help of node modules to function correctly. It is deployed to heroku and uses a database to keep track of all data that is on the application.
